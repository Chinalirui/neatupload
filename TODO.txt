Release 1.1

UploadDomains which limit size, bandwidth, directory, overwrite, etc. 
- Domains would be application-wide, and domain IDs would be MACed into postBackIds.
- UploadDomains create UploadedFiles that FilteringWorkerRequest stores in UploadContext
- UploadedFiles provide outputStreams to FilteringWorkerRequest
- Those streams can limit bandwidth, filesize, etc.
- To avoid creating large numbers of domains, do moves/overwrites in InputFile
